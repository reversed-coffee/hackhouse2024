            you can tell i have peak laziness when i include the 'phishing' log script in both 
            the real and phishing site. client checks are amazing, aren't they?
            no but for real, I cannot bother to make two sources. if this was a professional
            project, I would have over-engineered this with a build script and all that random
            stuff that you don't really need for a small project and gives you a headache

                    Thought this would be a nice touch, but I don't think anyone would bother to actually look. And I'm glad they don't,
                    because the source (as of writing this) is complete and utter garbage. I'm proud that it works; Not proud of how the
                    'guts' look. I don't do frontend and I was delibrately lazy with the backend because this project simply just needs
                    to work for a presentation.
